# svelte-meet-us
A Meetup website for learning Svelte. 
Coded along with the course 'Svelte.js - The Complete Guide (incl. Sapper.js)' by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

Svelte.js (or just "Svelte") is a modern JavaScript compiler that allows you to write easy-to-understand JavaScript code which is then compiled to highly efficient code that runs in the browser.
